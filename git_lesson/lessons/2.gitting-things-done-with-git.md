# 2. "Gitting" things done with Git

## Lesson Objectives
In this lesson, we will:
- create a local Git repository
- introduce ourselves to Git
- learn how to organize and track our changes with Git

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Initializing a local Git Repository
Congratulations, you are about to start actually using Git!

To begin the lesson, navigate into the `workshop` directory we had you download earlier.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <p>

  ```bash
  cd ~/Desktop/workshop/
  ```

  </p>
</details>

Now...a local Git repository is just a directory on your computer that you tell Git to keep track of.
So let's make a fresh directory called `git_lesson` to get started.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <p>

  ```bash
  mkdir git_lesson
  ```

  </p>
</details>

Now we can convert this directory into a Git repository using the `git init` command. First, we navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd git_lesson
```

And then we initialize the repository with `git init`:

```bash
git init
```

And voil√†! We have a Git repository!

### How do I know it worked?
Remember, Git repositories are just directories that contain a special `.git` directory inside them.
To see that this is the case, let's list **ALL** the contents of the `git_lesson` directory.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <p>

  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

  </p>
</details>

You should see this:

```text
. ..  .git
```

Good. You have just created a local Git repository!

### What if I initialize a Git repository by mistake?
Imagine we just initialized a Git repository, and then realized that we weren't in the right directory. Yikes! What can we do?

Remember: a local Git repository is just a directory with a `.git` subdirectory. So all we need to do is remove that `.git` directory!

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <p>

  ```bash
  rm -r .git
  ```

  </p>

  Since the `.git` directory is a special hidden directory, bash may ask you some questions to confirm that you really want to get rid of it. Answer `yes` to the questions if you are sure you want to remove the `.git` directory.

  If you want bash to perform the removal without asking you these questions, you can do:
  <p>

  ```bash
  rm -rf .git
  ```

  </p>

  The `f` there is an instance of the `--force` argument (`-f` for short). This forces through dangerous operations like `rm`. ***Use at your own risk!***

</details>

Boom. Problem solved :wink:

### Do I have to start from a new directory?
Suppose you have a project you've been working on and you want to start tracking it with Git.

Of course you *could* make a new directory, initialize it as a Git repository with `git init`, and then move all your files from their current location into the newly minted Git repository.

But who wants to do all that?

In actuality, you can convert any directory into a Git repository. All you need to do is:
1. Move into the directory
2. `git init`

This works on directories that already have content. Let's practice that!

First, make sure you're at the top of the `workshop` directory:

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <p>

  ```bash
  cd ~/Desktop/workshop
  ```

  </p>

  OR:

  <p>

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

  </p>

  (Goes up one level from `git_lesson` to `workshop`.)

</details>


Convert this to a Git repository so we can track our work!

```bash
git init
```

Nice! :thumbsup:

We will continue to use this directory as a Git repository so that you can track the work we do in the workshop (from here on, at least) with Git!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduce yourself to Git!
Git works by creating special identifiers for changes that you make to files. These identifiers are generated in part based on the author of the changes (among many other things).

Consequently, Git needs to know who you are! Let's introduce ourselves to Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME HERE"
git config --global user.email "YOUR GITHUB EMAIL HERE"
```

By telling Git your name, you allow Git to tag your activity as being authored by you. By telling Git the email associated with your GitHub account, you allow for communication between the Git installed on your computer, and the Git used on GitHub. More about this later!

This introduction was a one-time thing. Now you are ready to use Git!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## First things first...
I want you **trust me**, and blindly do the following:

```bash
git add --all
git commit --message "initialize the workshop directory as a repository"
```

I just had you use Git to record the act of initializing the `workshop` directory as a repo. You created a **commit** (i.e., a snapshot/checkpoint in time) that contained `--all` the content of the directory, and which you labeled with the message `initialize the workshop directory as a repository`.

This two-step process is the essence of how Git works. Rather than a single `save` operation, Git works by having you:
1. tell it which parts of the work that you have done you want to commit to the repository
2. save a snapshot of the entire repository that includes that work, with a message describing what you did

This two-step process is represented here:

</p>

The **working directory**, or **working copy**, is the copy of the repository that you have on your computer right now. It's called that because it's the copy of the repository that you are working on.

The **staging directory**, or **staging area**, is a copy of the repository that Git uses to prepare for a commit. It's called that because it's the copy that Git uses to "stage", or prepare, a commit.

The **repository** here is the official state of the Git repository. Git tracks your changes in part by comparing your *working copy* of the repository to the official copy.

>Notice that this two-step process is more powerful than a traditional "save". When you save, you are necessarily saving every change that you have made. By adding changes to the staging area first, then committing them (i.e., saving them), you can change a lot of stuff but choose to save only some of those changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## A Very Basic Git-based Work Cycle
Here is a basic cycle that you can follow to work with Git:
1. Do some work to a file
2. `git add <file>`: add the changes you made to that file to the staging area
3. `git commit --message "COMMIT MESSAGE"`: commit those changes to the repository

Let's give it a try! First, let's navigate into the `git` directory inside our repo.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/workshop/git_lesson
```

Right now, this folder should be empty:

```bash
ls
```

Let's create a new file called `practice.txt`:

```bash
touch practice.txt
ls
```

Ok, that worked as expected. We have a new file in the directory.

Suppose we want to **commit** this new file to the repository. What do we need to do first?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  Add the file that we created to the staging area:

  <p>

  ```bash
  git add practice.txt
  ```

  </p>
</details>

And what do we need to do next?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  Commit the changes (adding a new file) to the repository with a message:

  <p>

  ```bash
  git commit --message "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"
  ```

  </p>
</details>

Great! you have now made **2 commits** to the workshop repository:
1. You committed the files that were in the `workshop` directory to the repository
2. You committed a new file to the `workshop/git_lesson` subdirectory

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Improving Our Git-based Work Cycle with `git status` and `git diff`
We've learned how to **commit changes to a Git repository**. But committing is a very decisive action (that's why they call it a commit).

There are two commands that Git provides to help you monitor the work you've been doing, what changes are staged for a commit, and what changes are not staged for a commit. This can help you be more confident about the changes that you want to commit.

The first command is `git status`. Try it now:

```bash
git status
```

Git should give you a message like this:

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

>You don't need to worry about this message other than to know that Git is telling you that your working copy matches the official repo. In other words, you haven't made any changes inside the repo.

Let's try changing something now. Add a line to `practice.txt`. To do so, let's practice using `>>` to append to an existing file!

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <p>

  ```bash
  echo "This line was added to 'practice.txt' using '>>' in bash" >> practice.txt
  ```

  </p>
</details>

Let's check back in with Git and see what it thinks happened:

```bash
git status
```

You should get an output like this:

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   practice.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

As you can see, Git has noticed that you have `modified` the file `practice.txt`. Neat!

Git has also noted that there are `no changes added to commit`, and helpfully suggests using `git add`.

`git status` can tell us that `practice.txt` was modified, but it does not tell us what those modification are. This is where `git diff` comes in:

```bash
git diff
```

>`git diff` is short for "show me the difference between my working copy and the staging area." Git uses `+` and `-` to indicate lines that are added or subtracted, respectively.

You should get an output like the following:

```text
diff --git a/git_lesson/practice.txt b/git_lesson/practice.txt
index e69de29..b5cfe91 100644
--- a/git_lesson/practice.txt
+++ b/git_lesson/practice.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+This line was added to 'practice.txt' using '>>' in bash
```

The last line there is the line that we added to `practice.txt`, with a `+` in front of it indicating that the line was added to the file.

Those changes look good, and we want to commit them to our repository. Let's take Git's advice from the status report and *add practice.txt to the staging area*:

```bash
git add practice.txt
```

Let's see how this changed our `git status` report for the repository.

```bash
git status
```

You should get output like this:

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   practice.txt
```

Now that we have *added practice.txt to the staging area*, Git tells us we have `Changes to be committed:` instead of `Changes not staged for commit:`. Yay!

>Git is full of "helpful" advice (the advice gets more helpful as you get more used to Git's terminology). Here, Git tells us how to remove this change from the staging area if we don't want to commit it.

Hurray! Let's **commit** our changes to the repo:

```bash
git commit --message "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"
```

>Pro tip: git commit --message can be abbreviated to git commit -m.

Let's see if the status of our repo is different now:

```bash
git status
```

We should see the following:

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Nice, we are back to that message telling us that our working copy, the staging area, and the official repo are all the same.

Now that we've learned bout `git status` and `git diff`, let's update our Git-based work cycle:
1. Do some work to a file
2. `git status`: see what files have changed since the last commit
3. `git diff`: see all the changes between your working copy and the staging area
4. `git add <file>`: add changes you made to <file> to the staging area
5. `git status` (again): confirm that you are about to commit what you think you are about to commit
6. `git commit --message "COMMIT MESSAGE"`: commit your staged changes to the repository with a message
7. Rinse and repeat as needed

Bravo! :clap: You've made another commit, and learned about `git status` and `git diff`!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Reviewing your commit history
Let's imagine that it's two weeks from now, and you are trying to remember what you learned in this workshop. You remember that you did some things with Git, which you recorded as "commits". But what were those commits? You can't seem to remember!

Git can help you here. As long as you are inside your Git repository, you can see a log of your recent commits to help you remember what you were doing:

```bash
git log
```

Notice that your output contains something like the following:

```text
commit d6580d98545a223319c1a0ca1a58e5b468839ccc (HEAD -> master)
Author: Noah Richard Nelson <noah.nelson.11@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 21 12:41:20 2019 -0700

    added line to practice.txt and practiced the git status and git diff commands

commit e63c250d2f84332b1759a3618395cf8e375ed9ff
Author: Noah Richard Nelson <noah.nelson.11@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 21 12:00:03 2019 -0700

    practicing git commit

commit be438683506f5d26d31e20e46d8c9caa6f4ecd2d
Author: Noah Richard Nelson <noah.nelson.11@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 21 11:50:51 2019 -0700

    initialize the workshop directory as a repository
```

`git log` reports up to the last 10 commits in the repo, starting with the most recent commit and working backward. We only have 3 commits in the repo, so that's what it shows us.

Now you can see why we introduced ourselves to Git! It has our *user.name* and *user.email* in the `Author:` field! In fact, *Git will not allow you to make a commit without providing a user name and email.*

The commit itself has an arbitrary character sequence (called a hash) as a label. This lets Git find the commit easily, but you don't need to worry about that right now. Instead, notice that your commit message is there, floating in space, easy to find and to read. ***This is why it is so valuable to write good commit messages - they are messages to your future self!***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Exercise: DIY Git!
Using the same repo we were just working on, I want you to:
1. Change the line you wrote to `practice.txt` to be something else
2. Have Git tell you what you changed in `practice.txt`. How is a change to a single line represented?
3. Add a new file to the `git_lesson` directory. Call it whatever you want.
4. Make a *single commit* with *both* of these two changes included in the commit
5. Review the commit history to confirm your last commit

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  #### Change the line you wrote to `practice.txt` to be something else
  <p>

  ```bash
  nano practice.txt
  ```

  </p>

  (Edit something in the line)

  #### Have Git tell you what you changed in `practice.txt`
  <p>

  ```bash
  git diff
  ```

  </p>

  If you changed the line in `practice.txt`, the `diff` report should have the *old line preceded by a -*, and the *new line preceded by a +*.

  #### Add a new file to the `git_lesson` directory
  <p>

  ```bash
  cd ~/Desktop/workshop/git_lesson/
  touch file.txt
  ```

  </p>

  #### Make a single commit for both of these two changes
  <p>

  ```bash
  git add file.txt
  git add practice.txt
  git status
  git commit --message "add line to file and add new file in same commit"
  ```

  </p>

  #### Review the commit history to confirm your last commit
  <p>

  ```bash
  git log
  ```

  </p>
</details>

## Congratulations, you now know how to use Git in a local repository!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Terminology Covered
- **working copy** -- the copy of a Git repository that you are working on. When you make changes to the repository, they happen her first, and have to be: (1) added to the staging area, and (2) committed, before they are saved to the repository.
- **staging area** -- the digital "space" where changes to the repository are added in preparation for a commit.
- **to commit (v.)** -- to save the state of all of your files in the repository.
  - _I committed the changes to the repository._
- **commit (n.)** -- an individual instance of a committing event. A snapshot of the repository in time.
  - _The last commit introduced a bug in the program._

## Commands Covered
- `git init` -- Initialize a Git repository.
- `git config --global <configuration option> "configuration value"` -- Change your global Git configuration file to add or set a configuration option value. Git uses this file to determine who you are, communicate with GitHub (or other Git resources), and remember your settings for using Git.
- `git status` -- Check the status of this repository. Git will report any files that have been changed or added to the staging area.
- `git diff` -- See the difference between your working copy and the staging area. When `git status` reports a file with changes, you may wonder what those changes are. `git diff` will display them.
- `git add <file>` -- Add the changes to <file> to the staging area. If you are sure that you want to add *all* the changes to the staging area, you can use `git add --all`.
- `git commit --message "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"` (`git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"` for short) -- Commit the changes to the Git repository with a descriptive message.
- `git log` -- See a log of committed changes to the repository.
