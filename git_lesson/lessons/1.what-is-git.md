# 1. What is Git?

## Lesson Objectives
In this lesson we will cover:
- what is Git?
- why does this Git lesson barely scratch the surface of what Git can do?
- what is GitHub?
- what is a repository?
- local vs. remote repositories

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What is Git?
Git is a tool for "version control" (alt. "revision control", "versioning").

>Git is not the only tool for version control. Microsoft Word and Google Docs, for example, have features for tracking changes. But Git, as we will see, is much more powerful.

## What is "version control"?
We've all had this happen before. Researchers do this file naming thing. All. The. Time.

We do it so we can track the changes we make, collaborate with other researchers, and revisit old versions of our files. But there's a better way!

>Hint: we suggest using Git!

## What we want (as researchers) from version control software

1. Make it possible to *track changes* to documents, code, data, etc. *over time*
2. Make it possible to *organize those changes* in meaningful ways
3. Make it possible to *publish*, *collaborate*, and *share* your work
4. *Not* create 1,000 copies of the same file on our computer!

### "Make it possible" means the tool must be *simple*

Below is a hammer that you can use to drive a nail (the task of interest) at nearly any skill level:

***That simple tool is what we are shooting for in this lesson.***

Below is what git gives you out of the box:

Obviously, *this tool is too complicated*. Each individual component is probably very useful, but it's so confusing as to be useless until you know how to use each and every one of those attachments. We are *not* going to use this hammer here. Because it's confusing. And confusing is worthless for beginners needing to get something done.

Instead, this lesson will focus on a narrow subset of what Git can do to make it more approachable (the "Goat Path Git"). Our view is that, as researchers, you are probably pretty good at, well, *researching* how to fix a problem. If we can get you started using some basic aspects of Git, you will be prepared to learn what you need to make the most of it later!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## So...what is Git?
Git is powerful software to help you with version control and collaboration. That is, Git helps you to:
- track and organize changes to your files over time
- revisit prior versions of files
- collaborate with others
- and much more!

Git is built for the command line, and this is how we will learn to use it first (although it can be managed through various [GUIs](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)).

## Ok, so what is GitHub then?
GitHub (and other such platforms) is an online place to help you use Git for version control, collaboration, and publication of your work. Think of GitHub as a cloud service that allows you to share your work and collaborate with others using Git.

***Let me be clear:*** Git is *not the same thing* as GitHub!
- Git: a tool you can use from the command line. Something you can use on your local computer without ever interacting with GitHub or any other service like it.
- GitHub: a service/resource that makes using certain aspects of Git easier, especially collaboration.

### Why GitHub, and not some other service?
We like GitHub for a number of reasons, but perhaps the best reason is that GitHub is very popular! And when collaboration is one of the goals, popular is a good thing :sunglasses:

Plus, as a student, you can have unlimited private repositories with GitHub for the duration of your studentship :nerd_face:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Repositories
Before we can begin using Git, we need to understand the concept of a **repository**.

Git functions not by tracking changes just to individual files, but rather by *tracking changes to an entire directory*. "Repository" is the term used to refer to a directory that Git is keeping track of.

*Conceptually*, a repository is like a database or a digital warehouse. Are you working on a project that you want to keep track of using Git? Store the project's contents in a Git repository!

*Technically*, a Git repository is any directory that contains a special `.git/` subdirectory inside of it. That `.git/` directory is what handles the operations of Git. It is those Git operations that make the directory function as a repository (by tracking changes to the directory) instead of a normal directory (which tracks nothing).

Repositories are often referred to by a shorthand term, **repo**. There is no difference between these terms (other than 6 letters).

### Local vs. Remote Repositories
There are two "kinds" of repository, **local** repositories and **remote** repositories. The technical difference is nuanced, so I'm instead going to tell you how we will use the terms:

- **Local repository** -- any repository on somebody's *local computer* (e.g., personal laptop, laboratory workstation).
- **Remote repository** -- any repository on *GitHub* or a similar online platform.

You can use Git on either a local or a remote repository - it is not necessary to have both. Usually, however, you use both *(i)* one or more local repositories and *(ii)* a remote repository, with the local and remote repositories *linked together*.

We will start by learning the basics of git using *local repositories only*. Later in the lesson we will introduce remote repositories, and cover how to keep your local and remote repositories synced.

## Terminology Covered
- **version control** -- Alternative terms include "revision control", "versioning". Version control refers to tracking and organizing changes to code, files, etc. over time. For researchers, good version control software can also help us to collaborate, publish, and share our work with others.
- **Git** -- A powerful tool for version control.
- **GitHub** -- An online, open-source-friendly platform for hosting work done with Git (and much more). GitHub is dependent on Git, but Git is not dependent on GitHub!
- **repository** -- what we call the thing that tracks changes to our files. You might think of it like a database, an invoice, or a receipt of every change you have ever saved.
- **repo** -- short for repository.
- **local repository** -- a repository that you have on your *local computer*.
- **remote repository** -- a repository that lives *remotely*, typically online.
