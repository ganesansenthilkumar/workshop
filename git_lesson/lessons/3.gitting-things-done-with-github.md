# 3. "Gitting" Things Done with GitHub

## Lesson Objectives
In this lesson we will cover:
- why use remote repositories?
- creating a remote repository
- linking a remote repo to an existing local repo
- expanding the Git work cycle to incorporate a remote repo

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Why use remote repositories?
As we discussed previously, you can "Git things done" using only a local repository. So why use a remote repository at all?

There are 2 main reasons to use a remote repository:
1. Collaboration
  - work on the same files as your collaborators, using Git to keep track of everyone's contributions
  - let others know exactly what you've been contributing
2. Confidence
  - the remote repo can serve as a backup on the cloud
  - GitHub (for example) is popular enough that they have to take very good care of their servers

In addition, online platforms like GitHub provide some nice GUIs for interacting with your repo and viewing your commit history. These platforms also have a lot of helpful resources and tutorials for using Git both through their platform and from the command line.

## Creating a remote repository
We are going to create a remote repository on GitHub now.

>This is kind of like doing a git init for the remote repository.

1. Go to GitHub and sign in to your account (if you aren't already signed in)
2. Click on the `+` drop-down menu at the top right of the screen
3. Click on `New repository`

<p align="center"><img src="/images/GitHub_new_repo.png", width="80%"></p>

4. Name the repository `workshop` (the name should match your local repository)
5. Add a description. This repo will serve as a record of some of what you did in this workshop after you leave, so you may want the description to reflect that
6. **DO NOT CHECK OR CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE**
7. Click `Create repository`

<p align="center"><img src="/images/GitHub_new_repo_form.png", width="80%"></p>

>If we did not already have a local repo, we could have checked `Initialize this repository with a README`. Since we do have a local repo, however, we don't want any files in this remote repo until we have synced it with our local repo.

And voilà! We have just created a remote repository on GitHub!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Linking the remote repo to our local repo
You should now be looking at a GitHub page with `Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before` at the top of the page.

>You haven't done this kind of thing before, but that's okay. I'm here to help you!

Scroll down to where it says `...or push an existing repository from the command line`.

On the far right of the screen, click the icon that looks like a clipboard with an arrow. This will copy the Git commands you see below the heading:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/GitHub_copy_commands.png", width="80%"></p>

Return to your command line, and ***make sure you are in your local repo***.

Pasting the Git commands that you copied. It should look something the following, but with your repo's URL instead of mine:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/NoahRichardNelson/workshop.git
git push -u origin master
```

>If you are having trouble copy-and-pasting into the command line, you can type it manually. Just be *very careful* that you type it *exactly!*

Verify that you added the web address correctly (especially important if you had to type it by hand!):

```bash
git remote --verbose
```

You should get an output like this, with the URL matching the one from above:

```text
origin	https://github.com/NoahRichardNelson/workshop.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/NoahRichardNelson/workshop.git (push)
```

You have just:
1. associated your *local repository* with the remote repository on GitHub (called the remote "origin", and found at the URL you pasted)
2. told Git to "push" the contents of your local repository up to your remote repository.

Return to GitHub, and refresh the page for your remote repository. It should now contain the contents of your local repository!

Congratulations! You've created a remote repository and linked it to an existing local repository!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Using Git on GitHub
So far, we have learned how to use Git to track changes to a repository from the command line. GitHub also allows you to work directly on the remote repository.

Let's try making a few changes to our remote repository. You may have noticed that GitHub was strongly suggesting that you should have a `README`, a `LICENSE`, and a `.gitignore` file.

Due to limited time, we won't add a `LICENSE` or a `.gitignore` file. But you can learn more about [repository licenses](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#disclaimer) and [.gitignore](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files) on GitHub's help pages.

We will, however, add a `README`. To add a `README`, click on the green `Add a README` button located under the list of files and commits:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/GitHub_add_readme.png", width="80%"></p>

Notice that the file already contains:
1. the name of your repo
2. the description you gave your repo (if you gave it one)

>The `README` file is in a special format for presenting text files on the web using HTML. The format is called "markdown", and has the `.md` file extension.

Feel free to edit the file if you like. When you are ready, scroll down to the bottom of the screen.

Notice that GitHub doesn't give you a way to perform a traditional `save` operation. Instead, GitHub has an interface for **committing** your changes to the remote Git repository.

The first box in the interface is were your **commit message** goes. This is the `...` part when you work from the command line and do `git commit --message "..."`.

Add a *precise, concise, and informative* commit message about the changes you just made.

Making sure that `commit directly to the master branch` is still selected, click on `Commit changes`.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/GitHub_commit.png", width="80%"></p>

GitHub just performed the following for you on the remote repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit --message "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
```

When the page refreshes, you should see `README.md` as a file in your repository, with your commit message next to it! :thumbsup:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Keeping your local and remote repositories synced
Great, we just made a nice change to our repository on GitHub! We're all good, right?

Well, actually not really. Our *remote repository* was updated, but our *local repository* is not aware of the changes we made!

Keeping your local and remote repositories synced up is important. It makes sure that you have a single, linear history of commits that both repositories are tracking. If you do work without syncing your repositories, you will ultimately create parallel histories that can be very confusing to straighten out!

To keep the repositories synced, we need two key commands: `git pull` and `git push`.

### Pulling commits from the remote repo into your local repo
Right now, there is a commit in our remote repo that does not exist in our local repo. Let's fix that by **pulling** the current state of the remote repo into our local repo.

Go back to the command line, and make sure you are in your local repository:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/workshop
```

**Pull** from your remote repo:

```bash
git pull
```

>You will likely be asked to input your GitHub password. Do so.

Notice that Git now provides some information about what it pulled.

```text
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/NoahRichardNelson/workshop
  bbcdd8f..1be38cd  master     -> origin/master
Updating bbcdd8f..1be38cd
Fast-forward
  README.md | 2 ++
  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 README.md
```

Most of this is Git jargon that you don't need to worry about. But can you see how this is a reflection of the changes you made on GitHub?

```text
Fast-forward
  README.md | 2 ++
  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 README.md
```

It notes that `README.md` was affected. The `| 2 ++` is telling you two lines were added. Then Git reports `1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)`. That's pretty cool :sunglasses:

Now you know that your local repo is up-to-date with your remote repo!

### Pushing commits from the local repo into your remote repo
The final piece of keeping your local and remote repositories synced is `git push`. We already did a "push" earlier, when we pushed the state of our local repo up to the remote repo for the first time.

Let's practice using `git push` by changing something in the local repository and pushing it up to the remote repo.

`file.txt` (or whatever you chose to call it) is still empty from before. Let's add some notes about what we have learned:

```bash
nano /git_lesson/file.txt
```

Now let's verify that we are on the same page as Git:

```bash
git status
```

Git's reporting that we modified a file. Good! Now let's add those changes to the staging area:

```bash
git add file.txt
```

Let's double-check that it worked as expected:

```bash
git status
```

Good, Git is reporting the modified file under `Changes to be committed`. Let's commit those changes:

```bash
git commit --message "COMMIT MESSAGE"
```

Very nice, we did some very important work and committed the changes to our local repository. :wink:

Now let's push those changes up to our remote repo on GitHub using `git push`:

```bash
git push
```

>You may be asked to input your GitHub password. Do so.

That's it! Let's make sure GitHub is reflecting that last commit in our remote repository. Go back to GitHub, refresh the repo page, and take a look!

This gives us an updated picture of what we are doing with Git:

## An Updated Git-based Work Cycle
Now that we have set up a remote repository, let's revisit our Git-based work cycle.

Here's what I do every time I sit down to work on a project that I'm tracking with Git:
1. `git pull` -- Pull changes from the remote repository. I do this even if I haven't changed anything just to be safe and make it a habit.
2. `git log` -- Remind myself of my recent activity in the repository. What are my recent commits?
3. Do some work.
4. `git status` -- Remind myself of the work I just did, in broad strokes (files added, deleted, or modified).
6. `git diff` -- Remind myself of the work I just did, in terms of the specific changes made.
7. `git add <file>` -- Once I'm sure I want to commit changes to a given file, I add the file to the staging area.
8. `git commit --message "..."` -- Commit all the changes that I have added to the staging area with a clear message.
 - Repeat steps 3-8 as necessary
9. `git push` -- When I'm done, I push the changes to my remote repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Terminology Covered
- **origin** -- The reference point to use when linking a local and a remote repository. Almost always the remote repository. When syncing the two repositories, one will always be considered as ahead or behind the origin.

## Commands Covered
- `git remote add origin [URL]` -- Associate your local repository with the remote repository found at the [URL]
- `git push --set-upstream origin master` (`git push -u origin master` for short) -- If your local repository exists before your remote repository, use this to "push" the local repository into the remote repository **for the first time** (see `git push` below)
- `git pull` -- "Pull" the state of the remote repository into your local repository
- `git push` -- "Push" the state of your local repository into the remote repository
