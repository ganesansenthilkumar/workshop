# Challenge Activity!

### In the workshop directory, you should have another directory called `unix_challenge`

### Inside the directory are a number of files.

### One file is called `country.txt`, the rest are files corresponding to different countries.

### Take a look at `country.txt` and a couple of the other files to get a feel for what they contain.

### Here's what we want you to do:

1. Append all the content of the various country files into `country.txt`. This way, the contents of `country.txt` will appear like a "header" for the data in the other files. Verify that you did this successfully.
2. Using `grep`, extract all the rows of data corresponding to the year 1997 and put them into a separate file.
3. Commit these changes to your `workshop` repository and push your changes up to GitHub!
