# The UNIX shell
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including “high-performance computing” supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

# Some terminology
Here are some terms that are often used interchangeably – not because it's important to remember them or any differences (it's not for most of us), but just to have them laid out somewhere.

| Term     | What it is          |
|:-------------:|------------------|
| **`shell`** | what we use to talk to the computer; anything where you are pointing and clicking with a mouse is a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) shell; something with text only is a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) shell |  
| **`command line`** | a text-based environment capable of taking input and providing output |  
| **`Unix`** | a family of operating systems |  
| **`bash`** | the most common programming language used at a Unix command-line |
